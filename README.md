## Visual Resource consolidation/changes

The current spritesheets (for teams, events, and so on) are currently being updated in this [Imgur album](http://imgur.com/a/vjAmy). You can find them in the visual-resources directory as .psd files. (Side note: while .psd can be read by GIMP, it is not recommended to edit the file since GIMP does not support layer groups and may delete layers on save.)
